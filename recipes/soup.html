        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The deep red fruit soup is made from the berries of the black elder.
             It traditionally comes with small semolina or flour dumplings.
            Sour cream and chives can add a special touch to the sweet, fruity flavor.</p>
        <p>While this may sound a bit strange at first,
            you will be surprised how well they complement the sweet dish.</p>
